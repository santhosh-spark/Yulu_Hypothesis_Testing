# Yulu - Hypothesis Testing 🛴📊

Welcome to the Yulu Hypothesis Testing project! 🇮🇳

Yulu is India's leading micro-mobility service provider, committed to eliminating traffic congestion by offering unique shared electric cycles for daily commutes. 🚴‍♂️🛴

## About Yulu 🚀

Yulu operates in key locations, including metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, and corporate offices, to make commuting smooth, affordable, and sustainable. 🏙️🏢

Recently, Yulu has faced challenges with its revenues, and they've partnered with a consulting company to understand the factors influencing the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market. This project aims to uncover these insights. 📉📈

## How You Can Help 🤝

Yulu is eager to find out:

1. Which variables significantly predict the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
2. How well these variables describe the electric cycle demand?

## Dataset 📊

### Column Profiling:

- `datetime`: Date and time
- `season`: Season (1: spring, 2: summer, 3: fall, 4: winter)
- `holiday`: Whether it's a holiday or not
- `workingday`: If it's a working day (1) or not (0)
- `weather`:
  1. Clear, Few clouds, partly cloudy
  2. Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
  3. Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
  4. Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
- `temp`: Temperature in Celsius
- `atemp`: Feeling temperature in Celsius
- `humidity`: Humidity
- `windspeed`: Wind speed
- `casual`: Count of casual users
- `registered`: Count of registered users
- `count`: Count of total rental bikes, including casual and registered users

## Concepts Used 📚

- Bi-Variate Analysis
- 2-sample t-test: Testing for differences across populations
- ANOVA
- Chi-square

## How to Begin 🏁

1. Import the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. Establish relationships between the dependent variable, "Count," and independent variables like Workingday, Weather, Season, etc.
3. Select an appropriate test to determine:
   - If Working Day affects the number of electric cycles rented.
   - Whether the number of cycles rented differs in different seasons.
   - Whether the number of cycles rented differs under different weather conditions.
   - If weather is dependent on the season.

4. Set up Null Hypothesis (H0).
5. State the alternate hypothesis (H1).
6. Check assumptions of the test (Normality, Equal Variance). Use tools like histograms, Q-Q plots, or statistical methods like Levene’s test and Shapiro-Wilk test (optional).
7. Continue with the analysis even if some assumptions fail. Double-check using visual analysis and report wherever necessary.
8. Set a significance level (alpha).
9. Calculate test statistics.
10. Make a decision to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
11. Draw meaningful inferences from the analysis.

Let's work together to help Yulu make data-driven decisions and improve their micro-mobility services! 🚴‍♀️🔍💡

# 📊 Recommendations 📊
**Strategic Seasonal Marketing:** Given the evident seasonal pattern in bike rental counts, Yulu can adapt its marketing strategies strategically. Concentrate on promoting bike rentals during the spring and summer seasons when demand peaks. Consider offering seasonal incentives or exclusive packages to entice more customers during these periods. 🌼🌞

**Dynamic Time-based Pricing:** Leverage the hourly fluctuations in bike rental counts throughout the day. Explore the implementation of dynamic time-based pricing, where rental rates are adjusted to be more affordable during off-peak hours and slightly higher during peak hours. This approach can motivate customers to rent bikes during less congested times, optimizing resource utilization. 🕒⏰

**Weather-sensitive Promotions:** Acknowledge the influence of weather on bike rentals. Create weather-sensitive promotional campaigns targeting customers during clear and partly cloudy conditions, which typically yield the highest rental counts. Yulu can introduce weather-specific discounts to attract more customers during favorable weather conditions. 🌤️🌥️

**User-Centric Segmentation:** Considering that approximately 81% of users are registered, and the remaining 19% are casual users, Yulu can tailor its marketing and communication strategies with precision. Offer loyalty programs, exclusive incentives, or personalized recommendations to registered users, fostering repeat business. For casual users, emphasize seamless rental experiences and highlight the advantages of bike rentals for occasional use. 📊📈

**Optimized Inventory Management:** Analyze demand patterns across different months and fine-tune inventory levels accordingly. During months with lower rental counts such as January, February, and March, Yulu can optimize its inventory to avoid overstocking. Conversely, during peak months, ensure an adequate supply of bikes to meet heightened demand. 🚴‍♀️🚴‍♂️

**Enhanced Weather Data Collection:** Given the limited records for extreme weather conditions, consider enhancing data collection procedures for such scenarios. Accumulating more data on extreme weather conditions can facilitate a deeper understanding of customer behavior, enabling adjustments such as offering specialized bike models for different weather conditions or implementing safety measures during extreme weather. 🌦️📊

**Customer Comfort and Convenience:** With generally high humidity levels and temperatures frequently below 28 degrees Celsius, consider enhancing customer comfort. Provide amenities such as umbrellas, rain jackets, or water bottles to elevate the overall biking experience. These thoughtful touches contribute to a positive customer experience and can encourage repeat business. ☔🌡️

**Collaboration with Weather Services:** Explore partnerships with weather services to offer real-time weather updates and forecasts to potential customers. Integrate weather information into marketing campaigns or the rental app to showcase ideal biking conditions, appealing to users who prefer specific weather conditions. 🌦️🌧️

**Seasonal Bike Maintenance:** Allocate resources for seasonal bike maintenance. Prior to peak seasons, conduct thorough maintenance checks on the bike fleet to ensure optimal performance. Regular inspections and servicing throughout the year can help prevent breakdowns, ensuring customer satisfaction. 🚴‍♀️🔧

**Customer Feedback and Reviews:** Encourage customers to provide feedback and reviews about their biking experiences. Gathering feedback helps identify areas for improvement, gain insights into customer preferences, and customize services to exceed customer expectations. 📝📋

**Strategic Social Media Marketing:** Harness the power of social media platforms to promote Yulu's electric bike rental services strategically. Share captivating visuals of biking experiences in diverse weather conditions, showcase customer testimonials, and engage potential customers through interactive posts and contests. Implement targeted advertising campaigns to reach specific customer segments and boost bookings. 📱📸

**Special Environmental Discounts:** Given Yulu's commitment to providing a sustainable solution for vehicular pollution, consider offering special discounts on occasions such as Zero Emissions Day (21st September), Earth Day (22nd April), World Environment Day (5th June), and similar events to attract new environmentally-conscious users. 🌍🌿🎉
